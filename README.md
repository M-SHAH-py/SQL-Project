# 🧹 Data Cleaning Project using SQL

Welcome to my **SQL Data Cleaning Project**!
This project marks the completion of a hands-on data cleaning task using **SQL language in MySQL Workbench**. I'm excited to share my work with the GitHub community.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project was to take a raw, messy dataset and transform it into a clean, analysis-ready format using SQL. Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analytics or business intelligence workflow, and this project showcases essential techniques and best practices.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL Language**
* **MySQL Workbench**

## 🧽 Cleaning Steps Performed

1. **Removed Duplicate Records**
   Ensured data integrity by identifying and eliminating duplicate rows.

2. **Standardized the Data**
   Applied formatting rules (e.g., consistent casing, trimmed spaces) to bring uniformity across key fields.

3. **Handled Null or Blank Values**
   Replaced, removed, or addressed missing values to maintain consistency and reliability.

4. **Removed Unnecessary Columns**
   Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns that did not add value to the analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Data Cleaning.sql` – Contains all SQL queries used in the data cleaning process
